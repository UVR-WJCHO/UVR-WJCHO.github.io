I am a researcher passionate about developing technologies that make a tangible impact on the real world. With a background in mechanical engineering and a Ph.D. in culture technology from KAIST, my work bridges augmented reality, computer vision, and machine learning. My research has focused on enabling natural hand-object interactions in AR environments, leveraging advanced tracking, optimization, and dataset-driven approaches. Through projects spanning smart glasses interfaces to large-scale AI dataset construction, I have aimed to push the boundaries of immersive computing.

Beyond achieving state-of-the-art research outcomes, I am deeply interested in making these technologies accessible and practical for real-world applications. I thrive in interdisciplinary collaborations, leading multi-company projects, and engaging with global research communities. I enjoy exploring new fields, integrating diverse expertise, and solving complex technical challenges to drive innovation in AR and AI-driven interactions.
